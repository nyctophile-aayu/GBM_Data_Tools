Once you are done installing the GBM data tools. Then, install ipython interfaces on terminal.

1. Open Terminal. Now, follow the commands below:
 - conda install python
 - conda install ipython
 - conda install notebook
 - conda install -c conda-forge jupyter lab

2. Open the Terminal in that folder in which GBM data is present. Then follow the steps below:
 - python 
 >>> import gbm
 >>>
 >>> exit()
 
 - ipython
 >>> import gbm
 >>>
 >>> exit()
 
 If first line is running smooth as silk then you can be rest assured that your GBM Data Tools installation is successful.
 
3. Now, in the same terminal follow below command:
 - jupyter lab
 
 Now, it will open set of notebooks on your default browser. Open a new notebook and then again run the previous command:
 - import gbm
 
 If it goes well then installation is complete.
 
Enjoy GBM Analysis!
